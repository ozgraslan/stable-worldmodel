summary: Composable objectives and cost evaluators for planning
---

Solvers optimize action sequences against a [`Costable`][stable_worldmodel.planning.Costable] — anything exposing `get_cost(info_dict, action_candidates)`. Some world models implement it natively (e.g. TD-MPC2); for the others, this module provides the glue: a [`ShootingCostEvaluator`][stable_worldmodel.planning.ShootingCostEvaluator] composes any model exposing the [`Dynamics`][stable_worldmodel.planning.Dynamics] surface (`encode`/`rollout`) with a swappable [`Objective`][stable_worldmodel.planning.Objective], so changing the planning cost never requires subclassing the world model.

### The rollout contract

`rollout(info_dict, action_candidates)` receives **strictly-future** candidates of shape `(B, S, horizon, action_dim)`. Observation context arrives via the info dict: `pixels` holds `H = history_len` frames `(B, S, H, C, h, w)`, and when `H > 1` the executed action blocks *between* those frames are supplied as `action_history` `(B, S, H - 1, action_dim)` — frozen inputs, never optimizer variables. Inside the rollout, context frame `k` pairs with the action block leaving it (`action_history[k]` for past frames; the **first candidate** for the current frame), matching the training-time `(frame[t], action[t])` alignment. The output `predicted_emb` has shape `(B, S, H + horizon, dim)` with the first `H` entries being the encoded context — objectives that read anything other than the last step must account for this ([`GoalMSE`][stable_worldmodel.planning.GoalMSE] reads `[:, :, -1:]` and is unaffected).



## **[ Quick Tour ]**

```python
import stable_worldmodel as swm
from stable_worldmodel.planning import (
    CEMSolver,
    ControlPenalty,
    GoalMSE,
    ShootingCostEvaluator,
    WeightedSum,
)

model = swm.wm.utils.load_pretrained('lewm/pusht')

# 1. Single-term cost: last-step MSE to the goal embedding
cost = ShootingCostEvaluator(model, GoalMSE())

# 2. Multi-term cost: goal distance + action magnitude penalty
cost = ShootingCostEvaluator(
    model,
    WeightedSum([(1.0, GoalMSE()), (0.1, ControlPenalty())]),
)

# 3. Plug into any solver — the evaluator duck-types as a Costable
solver = CEMSolver(cost=cost, n_steps=30, num_samples=300, topk=30)
config = swm.PlanConfig(horizon=10, receding_horizon=1, action_block=1)
policy = swm.policy.WorldModelPolicy(solver=solver, config=config)
```

To plan under inequality constraints, pass objectives as `constraints=` — the
evaluator then exposes `get_constraints` and satisfies the
[`Constrainable`][stable_worldmodel.planning.Constrainable] protocol that
[`LagrangianSolver`](solver.md#example-constrained-planning-with-lagrangiansolver)
feature-detects:

```python
cost = ShootingCostEvaluator(
    model,
    GoalMSE(),
    constraints=[ControlPenalty()],  # satisfied when <= 0
)
```

### Split-latent models (PreJEPA / dinowm)

`PreJEPA` fuses the pixel embedding with one embedding per extra encoder
(proprio, action) along the feature axis. That latent cannot be scored against
a goal as a single tensor: it carries action slots, which a goal does not
prescribe. There is no special objective for this — point one `GoalMSE` at each
source and add them up with `WeightedSum`. The per-source goal embeddings come
from [`split_goal_encode`][stable_worldmodel.planning.split_goal_encode], which
[`default_goal_encode`][stable_worldmodel.planning.default_goal_encode] selects
automatically for such models:

```python
model = swm.wm.utils.load_pretrained('dinowm-pusht')

cost = ShootingCostEvaluator(  # goal encoder auto-selected
    model,
    WeightedSum([
        # extras before pixels, mean-reduced: reproduces the cost dinowm was
        # evaluated with before the objective was pulled out of the model
        (1.0, GoalMSE('predicted_proprio_emb', 'proprio_goal_emb', reduction='mean')),
        (1.0, GoalMSE('predicted_pixels_emb', 'pixels_goal_emb', reduction='mean')),
    ]),
)
```

The leading coefficients trade the sources off against each other. `reduction`
matters here: `'sum'` over a 196x384 pixel embedding versus a 10-dim proprio
embedding weights them ~7500x apart, so `'mean'` is what puts them on a
comparable footing (and is what the original cost used).

From the plan scripts, pick the matching config —
`objective=goal_mse_pixels_proprio` for `dinowm-pusht`, or
`objective=goal_mse_pixels` for `dinowm_noprop-pusht`, whose only non-action
source is pixels. Note also that the extra encoders consume the *same* context
frames as pixels, so `WorldModelPolicy.history_keys` must cover every extra
encoder input (e.g. `('pixels', 'proprio')`) — otherwise the fused
concatenation is malformed.

### Writing a custom objective

An objective is any callable mapping a populated `info_dict` to a
per-candidate cost of shape `(B, S)`. The evaluator rolls candidates out
first, so the `info_dict` already holds the rollout outputs (e.g.
`predicted_emb`) plus the raw candidates under `action_candidates`:

```python
import torch.nn as nn


class SmoothnessPenalty(nn.Module):
    """Penalizes large action changes between consecutive steps."""

    def forward(self, info_dict: dict) -> torch.Tensor:
        actions = info_dict['action_candidates']  # (B, S, H, action_dim)
        deltas = actions[..., 1:, :] - actions[..., :-1, :]
        return deltas.pow(2).sum(dim=tuple(range(2, actions.ndim)))
```

## **[ Protocols ]**

The structural contracts live in `stable_worldmodel.protocols` and are
re-exported from `stable_worldmodel.planning`. They are `Protocol` classes:
nothing subclasses them, anything with the right methods satisfies them.
