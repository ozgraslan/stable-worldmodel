class HistoryBuffer:
    """Per-env ring buffer over batched info dicts.

    Inputs are dicts whose tensor/ndarray values have a leading env dim
    of size ``n_envs`` (e.g. ``EnvPool``'s stacked infos with shape
    ``(n_envs, 1, ...)``). Each call to :meth:`append` stores one slice
    per env. :meth:`get` returns the last ``n`` entries strided by
    ``action_block`` env steps so history is surfaced at planning
    cadence regardless of frameskip.

    .. warning:: **Warm-up returns synthetic entries.** While an env
        holds fewer than ``(n - 1) * action_block + 1`` entries (the
        first steps after a reset), its history is left-padded with
        **copies of its oldest real entry** — for block keys, with
        **zero blocks**. The consumer (e.g. the world model) therefore
        sees fake repeated frames with zero actions between them, as if
        the env had been stationary before the episode began. Padding
        keeps the time dim at ``n`` for every env so histories stack
        across desynchronized envs without one env's reset truncating
        the others. All entries are real once the env has lived
        ``(n - 1) * action_block + 1`` steps. Callers that would
        rather shrink ``n`` than receive padding can size their
        request with :meth:`num_strided`.

    Output for a key with per-step shape ``(n_envs, T, ...)`` is
    ``(n_envs, n*T, ...)`` (concatenated along the time dim, oldest →
    newest). For a key with per-step shape ``(n_envs,)`` the output is
    ``(n_envs, n)``.

    Keys listed in ``block_keys`` are instead returned as ``n - 1``
    macro-blocks: block ``i`` concatenates (flat, chronological) the
    ``action_block`` raw entries recorded after strided frame ``i`` up
    to and including frame ``i + 1``'s entry — the actions executed
    *between* frames ``i`` and ``i + 1`` ("the block leaving frame
    i"), matching the training convention that pairs ``action[t]``
    with ``frame[t]``. With per-env per-step size ``D``, the output is
    ``(n_envs, n - 1, action_block * D)``. Missing blocks are
    zero-padded on the left and NaNs (e.g. the reset entry's action)
    are zeroed. Block keys are omitted when ``n == 1`` (there is no
    "between" with a single frame). Use this for actions when the
    planner operates at macro-action cadence.

    Args:
        n_envs: Number of parallel environments.
        max_len: Maximum entries retained per env (in env steps).
        action_block: Frameskip — stride used when returning history.
